# Outloop.PingPong

Outloop.PingPong is the first phase of a modular arcade sports project inspired by energetic, graffiti-styled visuals and responsive gameplay.  
This repository serves as a foundation that can be reused and expanded into other Outloop games.

---

## 📈 Progress Summary (Phase 1 + Phase 1.1)

In the span of ~5 weeks:
- **123 effort points completed solo** (compared to ~40 points by a team of 3 in the same timeframe on a past project).
- Projected to hit **126–129 points** by the close of Phase 1.1.
- Equivalent to **~10x the velocity of a single developer** in previous team metrics.

This includes not only raw features but also:
- Modular and scalable architecture (state-driven game flow, observer/event patterns).
- Clean refactoring mid-development to reduce future tech debt.
- Integration of visuals, UI, animations, and sound.
- GitHub workflows with milestones, feature branches, and structured merges.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Features (Gameplay Foundations)
- Basic Ping Pong mechanics with modular GameManager.
- Paddle and ball physics built for reuse in future Outloop titles.
- Player input migrated fully to the Unity **New Input System**, with multiple controllers supported.
- Visual feedback during play:
  - Hit particle effects.
  - Ready / Set / Go! UI with splash animations.
- Scoreboard UI with animated score updates and winner text.
- Match flow integration (ready → go → play → point won → scoreboard).

---

## 🔄 Phase 1.1 Features (Polish & Feedback)
- Refactored **score UI** to use TMP with tweening/punch animations.
- Added **serve indicator** (in progress).
- Added **sound effects** for hits, points, and feedback (US08).
- Introduced **Oswald font assets** + graffiti-style splash backgrounds to align with Outloop’s brand.
- Winner announcement integrated into match flow.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Complete serve indicator and US08 sound effects to close Phase 1.1.
- Move into Phase 2:
  - AI opponent.
  - Additional ball types / special shots.
  - Expanded polish for round transitions.

---

## 🖼️ Visual Style
- Outloop art style: bold, white-core graffiti titles with strong color splashes, inspired by *Street Fighter 6*.
- Scoreboard and match flow UI designed with the same cohesive DNA.

---

## 📊 Development Philosophy
- Using **SCRUM-like story points** to measure velocity and track milestones.
- Solo developer throughput (123 points in 5 weeks) shows the scalability of this workflow for larger projects.
